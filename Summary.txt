Summary:NAME OF PROJECT:Book Review Emotional AnalyzerDISCRIPTION OF PROJECT:This program prompts the user to input a book and the number of book reviews to be considered. In response, it creates a graph displaying the percent of reviews for that book that display each of five major emotions.  The program is written in Java, in which it connects to the GoodReads API, as well as the Watson API.  It uses Java servlets to run on the Tomcat server.  The user interface was built using HTML and JavaScript.WORK BREAKDOWN:David handled everything involving the tomcat server and the servlets, integrating the java code with the user interface.  He also dealt with exception handling and parsing the GoodReads API response using Jsoup.  Carson implemented the Watson API into the project.  He designed and created the Java classes (and Javadoc comments) and data structures necessary for the program to run.  Anthony wrote the HTML and JavaScript code for the user interface.  He also did all the JUnit testing.GITHUB REPO:https://github.com/cit-upenn/cit-591-projects-fall-2016-goodreads_analysis
